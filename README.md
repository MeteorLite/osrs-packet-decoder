# osrs-packet-decoder
Decodes ClientPackets for Old School Runescape (Will support Server Packets too eventually)  
  
Takes a rs-client deob, and further deobfuscates packet opcodes/sizes/names/structures  
Creates RL/RS api classes in /data/ (so you can copy them to your api, no refactoring needed)
